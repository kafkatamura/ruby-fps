![alt tag](assets/screenshot.png?raw=true)

A simple OpenGL first person experiment, implemented in Ruby utilizing Gosu.

Pre-compiled builds can be found [here](https://github.com/kafkatamura/ruby-fps/releases).

Rakefile is included for those who wants to make their own builds.

* Windows: `rake build:windows:folder`
* OSX: `rake build:osx:app`

If you're on OSX or Linux and still want to target Windows, use `rake build:windows:wrapped` to build.
